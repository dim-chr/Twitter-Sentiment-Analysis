# Twitter Sentiment Analysis


It is no longer difficult to understand what people think about a topic by analysing the tweets shared by people. Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular use cases for NLP (Natural Language Processing).</br>

The aim of this project is to analyse what Twitter users think about the vaccination against COVID-19.</br>


The project is split into five parts and it was implemented by using <b>Python's</b> `NLTK` and `Sklearn` Library. </br>

``` 
1. Data pre-processing and cleanup.
    ● Set to lowercase
    ● Remove stopwords
    ● Remove any url
    ● Remove hashtags ('#')
    ● Remove ats ('@')
    ● Remove punctuation
    ● Remove emojis
```
```
2. Data Analysis
    ● Number of positive/negative/neutral tweets
    ● Most common words used in tweets
    ● Most common words in positive, negative and neutral tweets
    ● Tweets that contain the word ‘astrazeneca’, 'moderna', 'pfizer' or 'biontech'
    ● Number of tweets per month
    ● Average number of favorites and retweets
    ● Number of negative tweets posted each month
```
```
3. Vectorization 
    ● Bag-of-words
    ● Tf-idf
    ● word embeddings
```
```
4a. Classifying tweets 
    ● SVM
    ● Random Forests
    ● KNN

4b. 10-fold Cross Validation
    ● Precision 
    ● Recall 
    ● F-Measure
    ● Accuracy
```
```
5. Modeling LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
```
```
6.  Beat the Benchmark
    ● Optimizing data even more
    ● Classification report for Random Forest Classifier with Word Embeddings
```
